                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Tony and I'm interested in pursuing a career in Software Engineering or Web Development. From 2012 - 2021 I managed a Compliance Audit for a financial services company in Seattle, WA, while learning coding (Python) as a side hobby. I'm currently back in my home state of WI, attending UW-Milwuakee Extended Campus' Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, in order to switch careers and put my coding acumen to use. Feel free to browse my portfolio at your leisure and contact me at the phone number or email provided at the bottom of this page.
                </p>
            </br>
                <p>
                    A little more about me: I grew up in Wisconsin and attended the University of Wisconsin - Madison, earning a bachelor's in Spanish Language and Hispanic Culture while taking the courses for the business certificate. I found a great job opportunity in Seattle where I had many best friends follow and spent the next 9 years hiking the mountains and foothills of the PNW, making friends, playing board games and learning to cope with rain. While pursuing an MBA, I learned to code with Python as a hobby and realized duirng the pandemic that I had a passion for coding and tech and that the tech job market would be much more stable. In sept 2021 I decided to take a year back in Wisconsin to be near my family and go back to school. I'm taking this year to explore tech, gain the skills I need for a web development and software engineering role, and spending holidays and game nights with my family. After graduation from the coding bootcamp 05.12.22 I hope to find a remote position with a responsible and sustainable company, that allows me to split my time between Seattle and Wisconson while continually adding to my skillset.
